## Overview
Jailbreak In Pieces is the first to discover the **"Cross-Modality Safety Alignment"** Phenomemon in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as a result of adding extra modalities to LLMs. We present novel jailbreak attacks targeting vision-language models (VLMs) that utilize aligned large language models (LLMs) and are resistant to text-only jailbreak methods. Our approach involves cross-modality attacks on the alignment, where we combine adversarial images processed by the vision encoder with benign textual prompts to disrupt the alignment of the language model.


```bash
# the code that optmizes the adversarial image in the CLIP emebdding space
cd src/
python adv_image.py
```
