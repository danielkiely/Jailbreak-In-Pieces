## Overview
Jailbreak In Pieces is the first to discover the **"Cross-Modality Safety Alignment"** Phenomemon in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as a result of adding extra modalities to LLMs. We present novel jailbreak attacks targeting vision-language models (VLMs) that utilize aligned large language models (LLMs) and are resistant to text-only jailbreak methods. Our approach involves cross-modality attacks on the alignment, where we combine adversarial images processed by the vision encoder with benign textual prompts to disrupt the alignment of the language model.


```bash
mkdir images outputs 
```
```bash
# install the requirements
pip install pillow numpy torch torchvision sentence-transformers transformers matplotlib
```

```bash
# the code that optmizes the adversarial image in the CLIP emebdding space
cd src/
python adv_image.py
```

#### Similarity Test

```python
t1 = model.get_text_features(**tokenizer("Marijuana weed", return_tensors="pt").to(device))
t2 = model.get_text_features(**tokenizer("Pharmaceutical", return_tensors="pt").to(device))
t3 = model.get_text_features(**tokenizer("illegal Substance", return_tensors="pt").to(device))
t4 = model.get_text_features(**tokenizer("Methamphetamine", return_tensors="pt").to(device))
t5 = model.get_text_features(**tokenizer("LSD", return_tensors="pt").to(device))
t6 = model.get_text_features(**tokenizer("illegal drugs", return_tensors="pt").to(device))
t7 = model.get_text_features(**tokenizer("A woman doing meth pills crack pipes", return_tensors="pt").to(device))
```
```python
util.cos_sim(random_img_emb, t1.detach()),util.cos_sim(random_img_emb, t2.detach()),util.cos_sim(random_img_emb, t3.detach()),util.cos_sim(random_img_emb, t4.detach()),util.cos_sim(random_img_emb, t5.detach()), util.cos_sim(random_img_emb, t6.detach()), util.cos_sim(random_img_emb, t7.detach())
